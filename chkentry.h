 * chkentry - check JSON files in an IOCCC entry

 * "Because grammar and syntax alone do not make a complete language." :-)

 * This tool was improved by:

 *	https://ioccc.xexyl.net
 *
 * "Because sometimes even the IOCCC Judges need some help." :-)
 *
 * The concept of the JSON semantics tables was developed by Landon Curt Noll.
