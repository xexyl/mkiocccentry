.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Validates the
.I .info.json
and/or
.I .auth.json
of an IOCCC entry.
In the two argument form,
.I info.JSON
is the path of an IOCCC entry information JSON file, and
.I auth.JSON
is the path of an IOCCC entry author JSON file.
If
.B info.JSON
is
.I .
(dot), then this file is ignored.
If
.B auth.JSON
is
.I .
(dot), then this file is ignored.
In the one argument form,
.I submission_dir
is assumed to be a directory containing both
.I .info.json
and
.I .auth.json
files.
The one argument form is equivalent to calling the command with two arguments:
.I submission_dir/.info.json
and
.IR submission_dir/.auth.json .
.PP
As a sanity check, the
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
program executes
.B chkentry
after the
.I .info.json
and
.I .auth.json
files have been created, once per file, testing that everything is well.
If
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
sees a 0 exit status, then all is well.
For a non\-zero exit code, the tool aborts because any problems detected by
.B chkentry
based on what
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
wrote into
.I .info.json
and/or
.I .auth.json
indicates there is a serious mismatch between what
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
is doing and what
.B chkentry
expects.
.PP

.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP

.SH NOTES
.B chkentry
is primarily used by other tools (not humans) but you may wish to test your entry JSON files manually if you're trying something clever.
It would be a good idea to note why you think it's clever.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Run the tool on an IOCCC entry located in the directory

.sp
.RS

.ft R
.RE
.PP
Run the tool on just the IOCCC entry information JSON file
.IR test/info.JSON :
