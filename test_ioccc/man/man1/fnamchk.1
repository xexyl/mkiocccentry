.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fnamchk
verifies that an IOCCC compressed tarball is properly named.
.PP
The program validates that the filename is correct, in the form of
.B entry.contest_ID\-entry_num.timestamp.ext
where
.B contest_ID
is either
.B test
or a valid UUID (see below),
.B entry_number
is an integer from
.B 0
through
.B MAX_SUBMISSION_NUM
(see
.IR limit_ioccc.h )
inclusive,
.B timestamp
is an integer of the number of seconds since the epoch and
.B ext
is either
.B txz
or the user supplied extension from the
.B \-E
option.
.PP
More specifically, the filename
.BR MUST :
.IP \(bu 4
Start with "\fBentry\fP".
.IP \(bu 4
Followed by "\fB.\fP".
.IP \(bu 4
Followed by either "\fBtest\fP" \fIOR\fP a UUID string in the form of \fBxxxxxxxx\-xxxx\-4xxx\-axxx\-xxxxxxxxxxxx\fP where \fBx\fP is a hexadecimal digit in the range \fB[0\-9a\-f]\fP.
And yes, there is a \fB4\fP (UUID version 4) and an \fBa\fP (UUID variant 1) in there.
.IP \(bu 4
Followed by "\fB\-\fP".
.IP \(bu 4
Followed by a decimal entry number from \fB0\fP through \fBMAX_SUBMISSION_NUM\fP (see \fIlimit_ioccc.h\fP) inclusive.
.IP \(bu 4
Followed by "\fB.\fP".
.IP \(bu 4
Followed by a positive non\-zero 64\-bit decimal integer.
.IP \(bu 4
Followed by "\fB.\fP".
.IP \(bu 4
Followed by "\fBtxz\fP" (or the user supplied extension from option
.BR \-E ).
.PP
NOTE: The quotes above should not be in the filename; they're there only to help distinguish the punctuation from the rest of the format.
.PP
It is indirectly invoked via the
.BR txzchk (1)
utility which is called by
.BR mkiocccentry (1)
and it will also be directly executed by the Judges during the judging process of the contests.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Show help and exit.
.TP
.BI \-v\  level
Set verbosity level to
.IR level
(def: 0).
.TP
.B \-V
Show version and exit.
.TP
.B \-q
Quiet mode.
Silence msg(), warn(), warnp() if verbosity level is 0.
Default:
.BR false .
.TP
.BI \-E\  ext
Change extension to extension specified (without the dot!).
This is used for
.B TESTING
purposes only!
.TP
.B \-t
If the filename does not start with the test mode filename format, issue an error.
In other words the filename has to start with
.I entry.test\-
or it's an error.
.TP
.B \-u
If the filename does not start with the normal filename format, issue an error.
In other words if the filename starts with
.I entry.test\-
it is an error.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
0
filename valid
.TQ
2
.B \-h
and help string printed or
.B \-V
and version string printed
.TQ
3
command line error
.TQ
4
"entry.test\-" separated token length invalid
.TQ
5
"entry.UUID\-" separated token length invalid
.TQ
>= 10
validation failed (see error message for details)
.SH NOTES
If there is an error in validation an appropriate error message is printed prior to exiting.
Otherwise the program will output the name of the required directory in the tarball (this is necessary for
.BR txzchk (1)),

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
For the examples below assume that the
.B MIN_TIMESTAMP
is
.BR (time_t)1662145368 .
.PP
Run the program on the filename
.I entry.test\-0.1562145368.txz
which will fail because the timestamp in the filename is less than the minimum timestamp:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 ./fnamchk \-t entry.test\-0.1562145368.txz
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Run the program on the filename
.IR test.tar ,
which will fail because the name format is invalid:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 ./fnamchk test.tar
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Run the program on the filename
.I entry.test.0.1662145368.txz
with the option
.B \-u
which will fail because it is a test\-mode filename but the
.B \-u
option is specified:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 ./fnamchk \-u entry.test\-0.1662145368.txz
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Run the program on the filename
.I entry.test.0.1662145368.txz
with the option
.I \-t
which will pass because it is a test\-mode file and the timestamp is not less than the minimum:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 ./fnamchk \-t entry.test\-0.1662145368.txz
.ft R
.RE
.PP
The above will print "\fBtest\-0\fP".
.PP
Run the program on the file
.I entry.test.0.1662145368.txt
with the option
.BR \-t ,
changing the extension to
.I txt
via the
.B \-E
option, which will pass because test mode is specified with a test filename, the extension matches the
.B \-E
option and the timestamp is correct:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 ./fnamchk \-E txt \-t entry.test\-0.1662145368.txt
.ft R
.RE
.sp
The above will print "\fBtest\-0\fP".
.PP
Run the program on the file
.I entry.test.0.1662145368.txz
with the options
.BR \-t ,
changing the extension to
.I txt
via the
.B \-E
option which will fail because the extension specified does not match the extension in the filename:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 ./fnamchk \-E txt \-t entry.test\-0.1662145368.txz
.ft R
.RE
.sp
NOTE: It would have passed if the extension was correct because the timestamp in the filename is not less than the minimum timestamp.
.PP
Run the program on the file
.I entry.test.0.1662145368.txz
without specifying test\-mode or normal mode which will also pass because the filename format is correct (in this case a test mode filename):
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 ./fnamchk entry.test\-0.1662145368.txz
.ft R
.RE
.sp
The above will print "\fBtest\-0\fP".
