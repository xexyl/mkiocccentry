.SH DESCRIPTION
.B jstrencode
converts JSON decoded strings into JSON encoded strings.
If given the
.B \-Q
option, the program skips double quotes that enclose each arg's concatenation.
If given the
.B \-e
option it will skip double quotes that enclose each arg.
To ignore newlines in the input, use the
.B \-N
option.
On the other hand, if you do not want a newline printed after the output, use the
.B \-n
option.
.PP
By default the program reads from
.BR stdin ,
if no arg is specified.
Otherwise it will act on the arguments to the program.
.PP
If given the
.B \-t
option it performs a test on the JSON encode and decode functions.
.SH OPTIONS

.B \-h
Show help and exit.
.TP
.BI \-v\  level
Set verbosity level to
.I level
(def: 0).
.TP
.B \-q
Suppresses some of the output (def: loud :-) ).
.TP
.B \-V
Show version and exit.
.TP
.B \-t
Run tests on the JSON encode/decode functions.
.TP
.B \-n
Do not output a newline after the encode function.
.TP
.B \-N
Ignore all newline characters in input.
.TP
.B \-Q
Skip double quotes that enclose each arg's concatenation.
.TP

Skip double quotes that enclose each arg.
.TP
.BI \-E\  level
Entertainment mode at level
.IR level .
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
0
encode successful
.TQ
1
encode unsuccessful
.TQ
2
.B \-h
and help string printed or
.B \-V
and version string printed
.TQ
3
command line error
.TQ
>= 10
internal error
.SH BUGS
.PP
A known problem with macOS Terminal is that one has to hit ctrl\-d twice in order for it to properly send
.B EOF
but this occurs in other applications as well so we note this issue here.
.PP
It is worth remembering that, for the
.B \-Q
option, if the string is not enclosed in double quotes (in other words, the first character and last character are both double quotes), the quote will not be removed, as it's not enclosed in double quotes.
.PP
If you have an issue with the tool you can report it at
.br
\fI\<https://github.com/xexyl/jparse/issues\>\fP.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Encode a string containing an escaped double quote:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrencode "test\\"ing"
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Ignore newlines in input:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 printf "foo\\\\nbar" | jstrencode -N
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Skip double quotes that enclose each arg's concatenation:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrencode -Q '"foo"' bar baz
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Run test mode:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrencode \-t
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Have some fun:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrencode -E 1
.ft R
.RE
.PP
Have even more fun:
.sp
.RS
.ft B
 jstrencode -E 3
.ft R
.RE
